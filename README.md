# jaxlogit: A Python Package for Estimation of Mixed Logit Models.

MSLE estimation of linear-in-parameters mixed logit models. This package is based on [xlogit]([https://github.com/arteagac/xlogit), with the core computational engine replaced by jax.
For examples and documentation of the API, refer to [xlogit](https://github.com/arteagac/xlogit).
This package is work-in-progress and the API might change without notice.
