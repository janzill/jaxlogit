        "The imported dataframe is in wide format, and it needs to be reshaped to long format for processing by `xlogit`, which offers the convenient `wide_to_long` utility for this reshaping process. The user needs to specify the column that uniquely identifies each sample, the names of the alternatives, the columns that vary across alternatives, and whether the alternative names are a prefix or suffix of the column names. Additionally, the user can specify a value (`empty_val`) to be used by default when an alternative is not available for a certain variable. Additional usage examples for the `wide_to_long` function are available in xlogit's documentation at https://xlogit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/convert_data_wide_to_long.html. Also, details about the function parameters are available at the [API reference ](https://xlogit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/utils.html#xlogit.utils.wide_to_long)."

        "Following the reshaping, users can create or update the dataset's columns in order to accommodate their model specification needs, if necessary. The code below shows how the columns `ASC_TRAIN` and `ASC_CAR` were created to incorporate alternative-specific constants in the model. In addition, the example illustrates an effective way of establishing variable interactions (e.g., trip costs for commuters with an annual pass) by updating existing columns conditional on values of other columns. Although apparently simple, column operations provide users with an intuitive and highly-flexible mechanism to incorporate model specification aspects, such as variable transformations, interactions, and alternative specific coefficients and constants. By operating the dataframe columns, any utility specification can be accommodated in `xlogit`. As shown in [this specification example](https://xlogit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/multinomial_model.html#Create-model-specification), highly-flexible utility specifications can be modeled in `xlogit` by operating the dataframe columns."

The data was collected through a survey where 12 different choice situations were presented to each participant. The multiple responses per participants were organized into panels. Given that some participants answered less than 12 of the choice situations, some panels are unbalanced, which `xlogit` is able to handle.
